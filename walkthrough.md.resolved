# GIMA - MVP Walkthrough 🏀

The Minimum Viable Product for **GIMA (LinkedIn + Hudl + AI Coach for wheelchair athletes)** has been successfully built! The project uses a Next.js (App Router) foundation coupled with a premium, custom Vanilla CSS UI, strictly avoiding generic frameworks to deliver that "Wow" factor.

## Changes Made & Features Delivered

### 1. Robust Design System
- **Premium Aesthetics:** We implemented a custom design system in [globals.css](file:///c:/Users/USER/Projects/gima/src/app/globals.css) featuring deep dark themes (`#0d0d0d`), glassmorphic panels (`backdrop-filter`), smooth micro-transitions (`0.3s ease`), and a vibrant sports orange (`#ff4500`) primary accent.

### 2. Authentication Flow (MVP Core)
- **Landing Page (`/`)**: A sleek, high-contrast entry pointing users to join as an Athlete or Coach.
- **Role-Based Auth Flow (`/login`, `/register`)**: Beautifully styled form screens managing the mock split logic between what athletes experience vs. what coaches experience.

### 3. Player Dashboard (`/player/dashboard`)
The core athlete profile interface:
- **Stats Card:** Rich, visual metric cards (PPG, APG, RPG, FG%, MIN). 
- **Injury Tracking:** Organized timeline displaying recovery time and real-time medical clearance status.
- **Match History:** A clean data grid showing opponent performance results (W/L badges, Pts, Asts).

### 4. Coach Interface & Affiliation
- **Discovery (`/coach/dashboard`)**: A search and categorization engine for coaches to find wheelchair athletes dynamically. Includes athlete attribute previews (PPG, APG, Sport, Position).
- **Messaging (MVC)**: An interactive [ChatPanel](file:///c:/Users/USER/Projects/gima/src/components/ChatPanel.tsx#5-71) widget available on the player's dashboard to mock direct 1-to-1 communication with potential future affiliated coaches.

### 5. Functional AI API Endpoints
We established independent mock internal Next.js endpoints intended to map to an LLM provider (like OpenAI) later:
- `POST /api/ai/summary`: One-tap AI insights synthesizing the athlete's progression over the season.
- `POST /api/ai/training`: Custom programmatic recovery/drills recommendations tailored for adaptive sports.
- `POST /api/ai/vendor`: AI-based vendor matching for customized titanium frames and carbon-fiber rims.

## Verification & Validation Results

- **Build Integrity Check:** the application was successfully checked against TypeScript errors (`npm run build` returned a perfect compilation matrix).
- **Current State:** A local dev server has been spun up in your terminal. 

### How to Test Locally 🚀

1. Navigate to **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser.
2. Experience the landing page gradient and typography.
3. Click "Join as Player" or "Join as Coach" (this will simulate the dynamic auth flow and take you directly to the mock Dashboards as MVP currently has mock-data).
4. **On the Player Dashboard:** Click the **✨ Generate Full AI Analysis** button. This will trigger the Next.js AI API and visually structure insights below the bio!
5. **Chat Panel:** Click the 💬 icon at the bottom right to test the messaging module.
